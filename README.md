This tool enables the user to produce the test results of a group of students so that they can efficiently analyze their performance and also, helps to predict their future test scores




The problem Test Performance Analysing Tool solves
This project makes it easier for students to compare their performance with other students and also find their strengths and weaknesses, and it's also helpful for students who are a part of local tuition classes to have a tool that analyses test performance on par with ones employed by high profile coaching institutes.
